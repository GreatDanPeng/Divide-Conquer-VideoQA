{"question": "Are there more then three different backgrounds appearing in the video?", "correct_answer": "Yes.", "predicted_answer": "Yes, the video shows multiple different backgrounds. The woman and man are initially lying on a bed in a light-colored room with a door and windows. As the scene progresses, they get up, walk through the door, and move to another room with a dark, cobblestone floor and a wall with a staircase leading upwards. In this room, they appear to be in the process of packing for an outdoor excursion, as they gather items from the floor and put them in a bag. They then walk down the stairs and re-enter the first room, where they continue their activities. There may be other rooms or backgrounds shown in the video, but it is not clear if there are more than three different backgrounds.", "score": 4}
