# Divide-Conquer-VideoQA

## Introduction
Current video recognition models are limited to processing approximately 2-minute clips, making it challenging to effectively understand longer content. Our goal is to extend this limit to 10 minutes by segmenting videos and leveraging existing video understanding models such as VideoChat and Video-ChatGPT. Instead of increasing computational costs by expanding model limits, we want to propose an efficient approach: dividing long videos into shorter segments, using LLM-based models to summarize each segment, and then combining these summaries for a complete understanding. This method allows us to efficiently extend long video understanding while extracting both high-level and detailed information as needed.
