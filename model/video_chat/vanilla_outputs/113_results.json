    "segment3": "Yes, the clip takes place in the 21st century.",
    "segment4": "The video is mostly shot outdoors during the daytime. There are some shots of people inside a building, and they could be either daytime or nighttime.",
    "segment5": "There are several different backgrounds in the video, including a man wearing a black jacket and tie standing in front of a brick building with plants and a window. Another shot shows a woman in a red coat walking through a grassy field. There are also shots of a man standing outside a window with a view of a cityscape, and a man standing next to a fireplace. Additionally, there are shots of people sitting in different locations, such as in front of a tree, in a park, and in a room with a table and chairs. There may be more than three different backgrounds in the video, but it is difficult to determine exactly how many without additional context."
