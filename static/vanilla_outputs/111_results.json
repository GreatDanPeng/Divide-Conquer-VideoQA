There is also a man dressed as a chef or a waiter standing in the background. The cat looks like it is drinking from the mug, and the man and the chef have a conversation. They talk about the cat's desire to drink a lot, and the chef advises him to hold off until he has finished his drink. They continue talking about the cat's desire to drink, and the man in the suit asks the chef what he would do if the cat drinks too much. The chef says that he would probably drink a lot more water. The cat continues to sit on the table and look at the mug, while the man in the suit and the chef continue talking."}
