{"question": "Does it happen during day or night?", "correct_answer": "Day and night.", "predicted_answer": "The context describes scenes that take place in both well-lit daytime environments, such as in a park and countryside, and dimly lit indoor settings, suggesting occurrences during both day and night. However, specific references to the lighting suggest that some scenes are clearly set during the day. Therefore, the answer is that the events happen during both day and night.", "score": 5, "type": "segments"}
