{"question": "Are there more then three different backgrounds appearing in the video?", "correct_answer": "Yes.", "predicted_answer": "There are several different backgrounds in the video, including a man wearing a black jacket and tie standing in front of a brick building with plants and a window. Another shot shows a woman in a red coat walking through a grassy field. There are also shots of a man standing outside a window with a view of a cityscape, and a man standing next to a fireplace. Additionally, there are shots of people sitting in different locations, such as in front of a tree, in a park, and in a room with a table and chairs. There may be more than three different backgrounds in the video, but it is difficult to determine exactly how many without additional context.", "score": 5}
